  Some time ago now (circa 2006) there was an <a href="http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf">academic paper</a> making the rounds somewhat brilliantly named “The camel has two humps”. This might be one of the best named academic papers out there, and although you might not think that would be a hard accolade to claim, <a href="http://goallab.nl/publications/documents/Holland,%20Hendriks,%20Aarts%20(2005)%20-%20noncsious%20effects%20of%20scent%20on%20behavior.pdf">you would be wrong.</a>
</p>
<p>
  In essence it posits that instead of a bell curve of programming success, there is a bimodal distribution; i.e. two 'humps'. It argues that there is a dichotomy between those who can programme and those who <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">can't.</a> One that can't be crossed by practice at all.
</p>
<p>
  It is at once an attractive and terrifying idea for someone starting or thinking of starting at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> to think that this is the case. It's attractive to to think one might be part of an exclusive community of the 'able to programme', and terrifying to think that on the verge of committing three months of one's life to programming, one might not.
</p>
<p>
 So what's to be done? How can we <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/">separate those who can from those who cannot?</a>
</p>
<p>
  Luckily, <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/18/the-camel-doesnt-have-two-humps-programming-aptitude-test-canned-for-overzealous-conclusion/">we don't have to.</a>
</p>
<p>Perhaps because of an unsound scientific basis, and perhaps in part because of the overwhelming number of people currently successfully learning to programme, the paper has recently been retracted. This is comforting for future Makers.</p>

<p>As you would think, the key to success in any skill isn't innate, it comes from practice. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0141036257">10,000 hours</a> worth if you believe Malcolm Gladwell. If you can do <a href="http://blog.makersacademy.com/how-we-find-the-best/">this</a>, most of the work <a href="http://blog.makersacademy.com/learning-how-to-learn/">isn't even programming.</a></p>

<p>If you <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-programmer/">want to be a programmer</a> and  you can practice and work hard, there is no camel.</p>
