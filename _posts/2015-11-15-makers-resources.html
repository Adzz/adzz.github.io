Also a really good resource to find people to follow on…..</p>

<h3 class="subheading"><a href="https://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></h3>

<p>Most people have twitter, and when you have an area or industry to be involved with it’s way better. Great resource for finding new articles, news, products…. and <a href="https://twitter.com/dphiffer/status/663372854726127616">hilarious dog vines</a></p>
