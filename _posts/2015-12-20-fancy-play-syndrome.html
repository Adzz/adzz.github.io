<p>Ping pong is a common game in the startup world. People have made ping pong <a href="http://startuppingpong.io/">leagues</a> specifically for startups, and startups <a href="http://www.lovecamden.org/bounce-home-ping-pong-camden">specifically about ping pong</a>. Check out <a href="http://get.uberflip.com/startupong/">Toronto’s league</a>, they  actually called it Uberflip*.</p>
<p>Ping Pong's resurgence to popularity at the hands of startups is as comical as its name is to pronounce, and to anyone who has never played ping pong, probably slightly mystifying. </p>
<p>But to anyone that has, it wont seem strange at all; it is weirdly addictive. There’s something deceptively simple about it that makes you wonder why you are no good at it. It’s a great method to switch off your mind without actually switching it off. More often than not afterwards you can go back to a problem you’ve struggled on and solve it almost instantly. It takes enough of your attention to stop you thinking about the problem that’s frustrating you, but not so much that it tires you out more.**</p>
<p>I’m coming to realise the similarities in style my Ping Pong game has with my coding ability. I’m a sucker for what some might call fancy play syndrome. I’m not so much trying to win as trying to take the perfect shot, successively. The problem with that style is any strength in it can be outdone by consistency in the long run. The time investment required to make my style a winning style is on a par with the time investment a professional payer would dedicate to his game. And I’m not trying to be a professional ping pong player. </p>
<p>I think there is the same temptation with coding. When I first started on codewars I felt a pressure to make pretty code; one liner genius solutions to problems are the aim. But in the real world, the time investment taken to get to them can sometimes far outweigh the realistic gains they provide. Especially when you are just starting, and you don’t know how to make one liner genius solutions… or a forehand topspin serve.

</p>
<p>Getting it working is far more important than getting it good. Well, to begin with anyway. The ultimate aim is to be able to do both at once, but until you can, do what you can do, and get it working.</p>
