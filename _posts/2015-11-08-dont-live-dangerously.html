<p>I take <a href="#">it</a> all back.</p>

<p>Don’t do it.</p>

<p>Follow the rules, do as you’re told. Don’t install zsh, don’t try and be a smart arse. It’s all too hard!</p>

<p>But seriously, it may have been several hours by now but after a few full uninstalls I HAVE A WORKING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT!</p>

<p>Well except for the Sublime command line tool, so instead I’ve decided to use Atom. For now.</p>

<p>I have definitely learnt a lot, but <span class="highlighted">sometimes what you learn isn’t always applicable to the work you’ve been set.</span> Sometimes you find working harder to be at the same level as others isn’t worth it. Of course you don’t know this until after, but still. From now on a good motto might be to keep it simple.</p>

<p>We’ll see.</p>
