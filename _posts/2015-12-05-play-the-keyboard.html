<p>It must be hard being a keyboard player. There is something fundamentally unimpressive about it.</p>
<p>There is a lot about making the keyboard sound good that can be hidden from a performance of it.</p>
<p>Sounds can be preset in, so as impressive as the music can sound, whenever you watch someone playing, there’s a small part of you thinking I could probably do that…</p>
<p>But they could play the exact same piece of music on a piano and you would be 10 times more impressed.</p>
<h4 class="make-green center-align">If you ever feel like you’re playing the keyboard just remember, you can play the piano too.</h4>
