Usually I try and make the mixins as tag agnostic as possible. Why? 
some examples. Doesn't feel right to include a tag in their definitions because it ties it too closely to what we are trying to style? Because I feel like the mixin should be agnostic about what it's being aplied too. The same way that we  might keep any method agnostic about what it's being called on?

But while attempting to improve the link styles on my blog I came across a notable exception. Taking inspiration from the amazing Wired website, i made the following mixin. I ncluded the a tag in the mixin because it allowed me to apply it to here: Which meant When writing a post I didn't have to keep repeating the class name on all the links. More importantly it meant I could apply the new changes without having to manually apply the class to every link tag on every old blog post.

coupling vs dry code?
